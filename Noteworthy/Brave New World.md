Dystopian book by [[Aldous Huxley]], considered to be ~~(one of?)~~ the first of its genre. 

It is usually compared to [[George Orwell]]'s [[1984]]. I personally enjoyed it more than 1984 and appreciated its take on media consumption and the  media, though it seems to be very exaggerated for  the purpose of social commentary.

The book is referenced in [[murray-2017|Hamlet On The Holodeck]] were Murray talks about [[the feelies]] machine, its dystopian dangers that warn us about virtual reality and the things required to overcome stupefaction as shown by [[Captain Kathryn Janeway]] in [[Voyager]]. Murray also talks of how the mirror the same concerns posed by Orwell in 1984 and by [[Ray Bradbury]] in [[Fahrenheit 451]] about television addiction.
