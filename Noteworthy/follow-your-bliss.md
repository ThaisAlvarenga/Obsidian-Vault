"Follow your bliss" is one of [[Joseph Campbell|Campbell]]'s most misunderstood quotes. 

ðŸ’­ This quote reminds me of the concept of [[Garden Of Forking Paths|forking paths]] (from [[Jorge Luis Borges]]) and the poem [[The Road Not Taken]]. He is basically saying that we should not worry too much on what the right or wrong path for us is, we should just let things unfold and follow our bliss. Whichever path we choose will be true to who we are and allow us to be fulfilled. 

For more context, he says: 

> Now, I came to this idea of bliss because in Sanskrit, which is the great spiritual language of the world, there are three terms that represent the brink, the jumping-off place to the ocean of transcendence:Â [Sat-Chit-Ananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sat-Chit-Ananda "Sat-Chit-Ananda"). The word "Sat" means being. "Chit" means consciousness. "Ananda" means bliss or rapture. I thought, "I don't know whether my consciousness is proper consciousness or not; I don't know whether what I know of my being is my proper being or not; but I do know where my rapture is. So let me hang on to rapture, and that will bring me both my consciousness and my being." I think it worked.

He saw not as a mantra or as a promote of [[hedonism]], but as a helpful guide to the individual along the hero journey that each of us walks through life:

> If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Wherever you areÂ â€“ if you are following your bliss, you are enjoying that refreshment, that life within you, all the time.
