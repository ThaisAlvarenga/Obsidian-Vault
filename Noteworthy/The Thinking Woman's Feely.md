#Chapter 

> ðŸ’­ I just love the title of this section. 

[[murray-2017|Murray]] dedicates a chapter to (and even names it in relation to) captain [[Captain Kathryn Janeway]] from the [[Star Trek]] series [[Voyager]]. 

Murray explains how in this universe, a common form of recreation/entertainment is the [[holodeck]]. 

The holodeck is compared to [[the feelies]] from Aldous Huxley's [[Brave New World]] were people prefer the feelies over genuine real life experiences. 

Murray argues against the idea that people will not be able to distinguish virtual simulations from the real world.
