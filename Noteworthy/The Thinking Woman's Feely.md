#Chapter 

> ðŸ’­ I just love the title of this section. 

Murray dedicates a chapter (and even names it) to captain [[Captain Kathryn Janeway]] from the [[Star Trek]] series [[Voyager]]. 

Murray explains how in this universe, a common form of recreation/entertainment is the [[holodeck]]. 

The holodeck is compared to [[the feelies]] from Aldous Huxley's [[Brave New World]]
