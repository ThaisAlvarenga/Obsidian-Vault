Thought of a way to phrase the type of research I am interested in:

> ludonarratives of the oppressed in the context of virtual and extended reality

> I am also interested in the usage of space as a medium for storytelling and the relationship between the audience and virtual space.

This came from reading about [[ludology of the oppressed]] in Frasca's work. 

It seems to be a field that has not been research that much and that is basically nonexistent in academia. 

The research can be further explored in the context of [[disability studies]].
