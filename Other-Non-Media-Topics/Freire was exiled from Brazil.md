[[Paulo Freire]] resided in Bolivia and later Chile during his exile from Brazil. 

The four year that Freire spent in Chile influenced his ideology and work. 

Freire says that:
> When I wrote Pedagogy of the Oppressed, I was already completely convinced of the problem of social classes. In addition, I wrote this book on the basis of my extensive experience with <span data-comment="I think he might be saying 'campesinos' instead. I should check the original quote.">peasants</span> in Chile; being absolutely convinced of the process of ideological hegemony and what that meant. When I would hear the peasants speaking, I experienced the whole problem of the mechanism of domination (which I analyze in the first chapter of the book)...Certainly, in my earliest writings I did not make this explicit, because I did not perceive it yet as such...Pedagogy of the Oppressed is also completely situated in a historical reality.
