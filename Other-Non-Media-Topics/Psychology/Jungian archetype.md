Jungian archetypes are like ==universal patterns or symbols that exist in the human mind==. They are basic, fundamental ideas or concepts that everyone shares, regardless of their culture or background. 

[[Carl Jung]] introduced the concept of archetypes in psychology. He believed that these archetypes are part of our [[collective unconscious]]. 

Jung's definitions of archetypes varied over time and have been the subject of debate as to their usefulness.
