Proposed by [[Carl Jung]], the Jungian shadow is an [[Jungian archetype]]. 

Concept that comes from Jung's model of the psyche used in [[Jungian psychology|analytical psychology]]. 

[The Society of Analytical Psychology's article](https://www.thesap.org.uk/articles-on-jungian-psychology-2/about-analysis-and-therapy/the-shadow/) on the shadow.

A known example in literature is the [[gothic literature]] novella [[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]].
