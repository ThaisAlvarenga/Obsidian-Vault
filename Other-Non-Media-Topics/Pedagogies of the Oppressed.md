Proposes the educational theory of pedagogies of the oppressed. 

Draws on [[Jean Piaget]]'s the idea that knowledge is **not transmitted but constructed**, and that construction can be detrimental if it is imposed by oppressors. 

However, Freire DOES NOT propose technology as a medium for education. 

His work can be expanded in the field of [[ludology of the oppressed]], studied by [[frasca-2001|Frasca]].
