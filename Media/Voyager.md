ðŸ’¡ My favorite start Trek Series! I watched it for the first time in my fall of sophomore year at NYUAD for the class Reaching for the Stars with professor [[Alia Yunis]].

I enjoyed the pilot episode best from all the Start Trek series. I loved that it deconstructed many of the criticism that I had of the previous series and how they handled indigenous rights to land, as well as having a female in a position of power as the central character.
