After you read or consume content that you want to engage with, you create [[reference notes]] quoting the content. You create [[literature notes]] on your interpretation of the content and then write your [[permanent notes]], which are your own ideas and conclusions formed from engaging critically with literature. 

The system can be summarized as 
[[reference notes]] -> [[literature notes]] -> [[permanent notes]]

The notes should be atomic: in other yours, you shouldn't write so much that you are scrolling to read your notes. 

You also should explain your ideas clearly so that anyone can understand regardless of whether they have read about the subject or not.
