# Hamlet on the Holodeck
Written by [[Janet H. Murray]]

[[Bibliography]]
	Murray, Janet H.Â _Hamlet on the Holodeck, updated edition: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace_. MIT press, 2017.

The original version is from 1997, but my physical copy of the book is from the 2016-2017 update.

Murray predicts the use of [[haptics]] in VR
