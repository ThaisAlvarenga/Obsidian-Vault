# Hero With A Thousand Faces

Written by [[Joseph Campbell]]

Originally published in 1949.

It is considered a work of [[comparative mythology]] and discusses the (similar) structure of different myths. This work originated the term of Hero's Journey or the [[monomyth]] as he called it in his work. 

Campbell was influence by [[Carl Jung]]'s [[Jungian psychology]]. 

The Hero's Journey is clearly evident in George Lucas' [[Star Wars]], particularly the first film  [[Star Wars: A New Hope]], were Luke Skywalker is presented as the [[archetypal hero]] hero. 

[[Marie-Laure Ryan]] dedicates her first chapter of [[ryan-2001|Narrative as Virtual Reality]] to Campbell's book.
