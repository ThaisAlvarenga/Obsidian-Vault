I'm saying apps for now, but it could actually be websites. I'm thinking of apps to practive iOS development. 

Ideas:

- [ ] [Homer Sympson website](http://www.homerswebpage.com/) inspired app ^[Maybe do it in the artstyle of Star vs The Forces of Evil]
- [ ] Something with Three.js ^[React App?]
- [ ] Pick an anime or show and do a website or web comic about it
- [ ] Location based website ^[Try somewhere in Honduras] You could use a parallax effect [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo3j_Dx4u7c).
- [ ] App that actually does something for my organization
- [ ] Parallax effect comic/story based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZKI-g-_qo&t=1788s)
