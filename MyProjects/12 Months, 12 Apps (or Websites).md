I'm saying apps for now, but it could actually be websites. I'm thinking of apps to practive iOS development. 

Ideas:

- [ ] [Homer Sympson website](http://www.homerswebpage.com/) inspired app ^[Maybe do it in the artstyle of Star vs The Forces of Evil]
- [ ] Something with Three.js ^[React App?]
- [ ] Pick an anime or show and do a website or web comic about it
- [ ] Location based website ^[Try somewhere in Honduras] You could use a parallax effect [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo3j_Dx4u7c).
- [ ] App that actually does something for my organization
- [ ] Parallax effect comic/story based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZKI-g-_qo&t=1788s)
- [ ] Tournament Arc simulator. Idea came from [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2B-FClr5rA). 
- [ ] Management System
- [ ] Productivity App or something I can use for work
- [ ] Something with an API ^[I would like to do it with Spotify. Maybe catering your playlist dependent on the emotion you want to feel.]
- [ ] Maybe an app that gives you movie recommendations based on what you want to learn about storytelling
