I'm saying apps for now, but it could actually be websites. I'm thinking of apps to practice iOS development. 

Ideas:

- [ ] [Homer Sympson website](http://www.homerswebpage.com/) inspired app ^[Maybe do it in the artstyle of Star vs The Forces of Evil]
- [ ] Something with Three.js ^[React App?]
- [ ] Pick an anime or show and do a website or web comic about it
- [ ] Location based website ^[Try somewhere in Honduras] You could use a parallax effect [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo3j_Dx4u7c).
- [ ] App that actually does something for my organization. Management System
- [ ] **Parallax effect comic/story** based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5ZKI-g-_qo&t=1788s)
- [ ] **Interactive Comic Book Reader:** Build a web app for reading interactive comics. Users can choose different story paths, make decisions for characters, and experience dynamic story outcomes.
- [ ] **Comic Strip Creator:** Build a web app where users can create their own comic strips. Provide a library of characters, backgrounds, and speech bubbles for users to drag and drop into panels.
- [ ] **Historical Time Traveler's Journal:** Develop a digital journal that allows users to "travel" to historical events. Users can write journal entries as if they were present during significant moments in history and share their entries with others.
- [ ] Tournament Arc simulator. Idea came from [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2B-FClr5rA). 
- [ ] Productivity App or something I can use for work
- [ ] Something with an API ^[I would like to do it with Spotify. Maybe catering your playlist dependent on the emotion you want to feel.]
- [ ] Maybe an app that gives you movie recommendations based on what you want to learn about storytelling
- [ ] A book application. 
- [ ] A TODO list that works for me (Animedoro for example)
- [ ] **Random Acts of Kindness Generator:** Create an app that suggests random acts of kindness for users to perform. Include a tracking system where users can share their completed acts and inspire others.
- [ ] **Art Gallery Showcase:** Develop an online art gallery where artists can showcase their work. Add features like virtual exhibitions, 3D art spaces, and interactive elements for users to explore the art.
- [ ] **Virtual Garden Builder:** Create a virtual garden planning app where users can design and manage their digital gardens. Add features like plant information, growth simulations, and even virtual events like garden competitions. I could use AFrame to do this.
