Stories that have only one narrative path. This is independent from the medium in which the story is presented. 

Regardless of whether the medium is interactive or not, if the form of the experience does not allow for the interactor (user/audience) to navigate multiple story lines and/or the same story line in a different sequence, then the story is unisequential.
