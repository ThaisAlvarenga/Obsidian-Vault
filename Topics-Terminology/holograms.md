An image formed by an imaging technique that uses an interference pattern of scattered rays of light to reconstruct a 3D image of the original object that originated the light-rays.

This is as defined by [[Dennis Gabor]]'s A New Microscopic Principle: 

>I should mention a new sub-microscopic principle which may open up new possibilities in the field of microscopy, viz., the use of rays which are scattered by the object and normally recombine. These rays may be made to form not a direct image but an interference pattern, the 'fingerprint' of the object. Such a pattern is called a hologram (Greek for 'whole message').

Gabor explains that holograms are capable of capturing and reproducing the entire visual information of an object.

The term hologram ==can refer both to the imaging technique and its three-dimensional result==.
