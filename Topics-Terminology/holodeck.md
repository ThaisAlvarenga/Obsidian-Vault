A fictional device from the [[Star Trek]] universe that runs holographic physical simulations that people can interact with. 

It uses [[holograms]] to create realistic and [[immersive environments]], with [[haptics]] and realistic [[holocharacters]] that respond to the user. 

It is described as a "recreational facility" and characters go there to entertain themselves; however, it is also used for training. 

>ğŸ’¡ I see some similarities between how the holodeck is used in Star Trek with how VR and XR in general are being used irl.
