[[Narrative structure]] that allow the user to move through multiple sequences of the same story. 

This term is presented by [[murray-2017|Murray]] as an alternative for non-linear stories. An overlapping term used is [[multiform]].

The term she utilizes to refer to stories that have only one narrative path is [[unisequential]]

With this terminology, she aims to distinguish non-linear stories with the more specific narrative structure in interactive media. Multi-sequential implies that there are multiple narrative sequences or pathways that the user can traverse through in a virtual environment. It is NOT concerned with whether a narrative is linear or not. The structure is not limited to thinking in the binary of a linear path or a non-linear path. ==It implies a more complex structure allowed by the form in which the story can be experienced. ==

For further clarification:
[[sequential-vs-linear]]
