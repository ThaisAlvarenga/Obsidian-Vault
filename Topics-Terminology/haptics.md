According to [[srinivasan-1995]] , haptics can be divided into three categories: 

- human haptics: the study of human sensing and manipulation through touch,
- machine haptics: the design, construction, and use of machines to replace or augment human touch.
- computer haptics: algorithms and software associated with generating and rendering the touch and feel of virtual objects
