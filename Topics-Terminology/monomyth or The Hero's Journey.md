[[Narrative structure]] proposed by [[Joseph Campbell]] in the book [[campbell-2008|Hero With A Thousand Faces]]. It is also known as **monomyth**. 

In his book, Campbell describes the structure in the following way: 

> "A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man."



Similar structures to the monomyth were proposed by psychoanalystÂ [[Otto Rank]] and amateur anthropologist [[Lord Raglan]], but it was popularized by Campbell.
