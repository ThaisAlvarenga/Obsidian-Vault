Introduction
- [[VR-offers-unique-potential-for-mental-health]]
- Present the issue of ludonarrative dissonance and how it is (perhaps unstudied?) in VR. 
	- Establishing empathy is key in mental health apps that use narrative as its primary device, as the relationship between the user and the characters in the narrative is essential to destigmatize mental health and promote. Ludonarrative dissonance places this relationship at risk and it is not a primary researched in the context of extended reality. 
	- As a new medium, Virtual Reality is still defining its narrative grammar, but it also presents opportunities to explore methods that are unavailable in other digital forms. 

Introduce Solution (our paper)
- Our project, Road To Acceptance, explores methods (animation and voice over) to establish inner voice as a way to create empathy between the interactor and the main character.
