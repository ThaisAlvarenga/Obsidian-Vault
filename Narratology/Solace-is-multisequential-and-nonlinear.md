#Narratology #VR 

> ðŸ’¡ I particularly resonated with Murray's clarification on sequential and linear terminology because my capstone, [[Solace]], was originally going to be "non-linear" as I would implement. However, the more I prototyped the story, the more I discovered that a branched modality was not the correct form for my narrative. 

Instead, I decided to create a circular narrative, similar to that in [[monomyth or The Hero's Journey|monomyths]]. However, the story was not non-linear as the story beats were experienced by the user in one sequence.

Though at first glance the events that occur in the Solace are linear, the fact that the actual environment in the story is circular whilst the story beats are presented as memories and reflexions means that the story itself is not linear, it is [[multisequential]] and linear. 

The previous terminology that I was reading regarding linear and non-linear narratives was limiting the way I was thinking of the story of my project. It was only until I started to think of my story as multisequential that I was able to reform my narrative structure to better fit the philosophy of the experience.
