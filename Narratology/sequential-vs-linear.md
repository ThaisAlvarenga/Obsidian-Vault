In the 2016 update of Chapter 2: Harbingers of the Holodeck of the book [[murray-2017|Hamlet on the Holodeck]], Murray makes an emphasis on changing the terminology used from linear and non-liner to 'unisequential' and 'multisequential'. 

This is a important clarification as the terminology can limit the way we think of story structure in interactive media. 

[[multisequential|Multisequential]] and [[unisequential]] are more descriptive, thus encouraging the careful design and construction of complex and coherent story forms. 

This clarification led me to the conclusion that my capstone project [[Solace-is-multisequential-and-nonlinear]]
